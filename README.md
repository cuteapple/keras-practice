# keras-practice

This is practice repo, it's meant to contain all the comment I feel and I think is important
hope it will help others in learning

It is recommended to follow *master* branch and looking at comments (in code)

Other branch may contains something useful, if you cannot follow whats happeded in *master* branch, try look inside (maybe a little mess :P)
